    "### Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, generates extensive data from matches, providing an excellent opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios. Perform the following steps to build a logistic regression model aimed at predicting the outcomes of League of Legends matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [league_of_legends_data_large.csv](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/rk7VDaPjMp1h5VXS-cUyMg/league-of-legends-data-large.csv) file to perform the tasks.  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: Load the League of Legends dataset and preprocess it for training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Loading and preprocessing the dataset involves reading the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features. You will utilize `pandas` for data manipulation, `train_test_split` from `sklearn` for data splitting, and `StandardScaler` for feature scaling.  \n",

    "Note: Please ensure all the required libraries are installed and imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 .Load the dataset:\n",
    "Use `pd.read_csv()` to load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.</br>\n",
    "2. Split data into features and target: Separate win (target) and the remaining columns (features).</br>\n",
    "   X = data.drop('win', axis=1)</br>\n",
    "   y = data['win'] </br>\n",
    "3 .Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:\n",
    "Use `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide the data. Set `test_size`=0.2 to allocate 20% for testing and 80% for training, and use `random_state`=42 to ensure reproducibility of the split.</br>\n",
    "4. Standardize the features:\n",
    "Use `StandardScaler()` from sklearn.preprocessing to scale the features.</br>\n",
    "5. Convert to PyTorch tensors:\n",
    "Use `torch.tensor()` to convert the data to PyTorch tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1:  \n",

It helps prevent the model from overfitting by penalizing large weight values, thereby encouraging the model to find simpler solutions.To use L2 regularization, you need to modify the optimizer by setting the weight_decay parameter. The weight_decay parameter in the optimizer adds the L2 regularization term during training.\n",
